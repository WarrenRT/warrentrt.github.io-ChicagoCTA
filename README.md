CTA Bus Tracker
<br>

<H1>Description:</H1>
The project was designed to show various bus stop locations in Chicago when users click on the button to activate the function that moves the location marker.
I changed the map style to satellite-streets-v11 because it provides users with a realistic view of the city and a better view of where places are located. I also placed coordinates of various bus stops in Chicago in the bus stop array.

<H1>How to Run:</H1>
Dowload all three files and save them in the same folder. Open the HTML file to view as a webpage.
<br>

<H1>Roadmap of future improvements:</H1>
In the future, I'd like to focus on locations of bus stops in a particular area.
